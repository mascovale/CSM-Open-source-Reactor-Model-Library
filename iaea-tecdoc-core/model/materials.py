# TECDOC-643 specifies no graphite density; neither model assigns a mass
# density to this material — the atom density above is the specification on
# both sides. The 1.7400 g/cm3 previously here was this same atom density
# back-converted and rounded (8.724000E-02 -> 1.74000 g/cm3 using OpenMC's
# isotopic masses, M_eff = 12.01112 from 0.988922 x 12.000000 +
# 0.011078 x 13.00335484); it reproduced the atom density to 0.0003%, inside

# DEPLETION ZONING — per-element, per-(x,z)-zone fuel meat materials
#
# RESOLUTION: N_X_ZONES x N_AXIAL_ZONES = 2 x 10 = 20 zones per element.
# x is the meat WIDTH direction (MEAT_WIDTH, 6.3 cm); z is axial. The plate
# stacking direction y is NOT subdivided.
#
# [MCNP — Kyle confirmed 2026-08-12] The reference MCNP model subdivides EACH
# FUEL PLATE 2 x 10. This is transcribed authority, not an inference, and it
# replaces the [ASSUMED] 8 x 20 recorded below.
#
# --- SUBDIVISION AND GRANULARITY — BOTH NOW CONFIRMED ------------------------
# These are two different claims. Kyle answered both on 2026-08-12:
#
#   SUBDIVISION  per plate, 2 x 10   ->  12,280 cells  [MCNP — Kyle 2026-08-12]
#   MATERIALS    per plate, per zone ->  12,280 mats   [MCNP — Kyle 2026-08-12]
#
# CELLS AND MATERIALS ARE NOW 1:1 — one material per meat cell, each owning
# exactly one plate's zone volume (MEAT_ZONE_VOLUME_PER_PLATE, 0.9639 cm^3).
# No plate shares a material with any other. The std/ctrl volume distinction
# that existed under element-shared materials is GONE: there is no longer a
# 23-plate or 17-plate multiplier anywhere in the material path.
#
# --- THE 560 SCHEME WAS NOT A BUG. READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" ANYTHING. -------
# Until 2026-08-12 all 23 plates of a standard element (17 of a control element)
# shared ONE material per (x, z) zone: 28 x 20 = 560 materials over the same
# 12,280 cells. That was VALID OpenMC. OpenMC does NOT require a 1:1
# cell-to-material mapping; many cells sharing one material is normal, fully
# supported, and still used elsewhere in this model (clad, water, graphite...).
#
# It was a MODELING CHOICE, and this is what it meant physically: a depletion
# solve would have seen ONE flux and reaction-rate spectrum averaged over all
# plates of an element in a given (x, z) zone, so plate-to-plate burnup
# gradients WITHIN an element could not develop. Per-plate materials let them.
#
# We changed it to MATCH THE REFERENCE MODEL, not to correct a defect. Anyone
# reading the diff should not record this as a bug fix.
#
# --- SUPERSEDED, IN ORDER — the history is the point -------------------------
# Three values have been recorded here. None of the earlier ones are deleted,
# because how we arrived at the current one is itself the record.
#
# (1) 5 axial zones, no x subdivision.  [MCNP-VISUAL, SUPERSEDED]
#     Implemented until 2026-08-12, on a visual reading of a zx slice plot of
#     the reference MCNP model. NEVER confirmed by Kyle and, as a reading,
#     REMAINS UNCONFIRMED. Retained as a record of what was inferred, NOT as a
#     live claim:
#       * 5 axial depletion zones over the active height  [MCNP-VISUAL, SUPERSEDED]
#       * uniform zone height (60/5 = 12.0 cm)   [DERIVED, MCNP-VISUAL, SUPERSEDED]
#       * all plates in an element share a zone material
#                                                [MCNP-VISUAL, inferred, RETIRED]
#       * one unique material per element per zone        [MCNP-VISUAL, SUPERSEDED]
#     Note the third: plate-sharing is the ONE inference still implemented, and
#     it is still unconfirmed. Superseding the zone COUNT does not retire it.
#     Kyle's 2026-08-12 answer superseded the COUNT twice over and STILL has not
#     retired it — see the granularity block above.
#       ^^ RETIRED 2026-08-12. The paragraph above is kept verbatim as the
#          record of what was believed and for how long. What retired it was a
#          SEPARATE answer from Kyle on the same day — per-plate materials —
#          not either of the zone-count supersessions, exactly as the paragraph
#          warned. Cells and materials are now 1:1; see the granularity block.
#
#     NO [MCNP-VISUAL] CLAIM REMAINS LIVE IN THE ZONING SCHEME. Every
#     [MCNP-VISUAL] string still present in this file sits inside a dated
#     SUPERSEDED/RETIRED record above, or is the negative statement in (2)
#     below about what 8 x 20 did NOT carry. None is an active assertion about
#     the reference model. Checked by enumeration on 2026-08-12, not assumed.
#
# (2) 8 x 20.  [ASSUMED, SUPERSEDED]
#     Implemented 2026-08-12, superseded the same day by Kyle's answer. It was
#     OUR OWN resolution choice and was NEVER a claim about the reference model:
#     not transcribed from it, not read off any plot of it, not stated in
#     TECDOC-643. It carried no [MCNP], [MCNP-VISUAL] or [TECDOC] authority and
#     was tagged [ASSUMED] throughout. Recorded so that a reader who finds
#     8 x 20 in the history knows it was a placeholder resolution, not evidence.
#
# (3) 2 x 10.  [MCNP — Kyle confirmed 2026-08-12]  <-- LIVE, implemented below.
#
# --- A FOURTH, SEPARATE NUMBER — do not conflate ----------------------------
# [TECDOC-643 App. A-2, Sec. 3.1 "Burnup Results", p. 31] states that the
# three-dimensional burnup calculations for the HEU and LEU cores were first
# performed with the REBUS-3 fuel cycle analysis code using HALF-CORE SYMMETRY
# and EIGHT AXIAL DEPLETION ZONES ABOVE THE CORE MIDPLANE, on ENDF/B-IV cross
# sections generated with EPRI-CELL in five energy groups.
#
# READ THAT CAREFULLY. It is eight zones per HALF core, under half-core
# symmetry — i.e. SIXTEEN zones over the full active height if mirrored, NOT
# eight over the active height. Every axial number on record, stated together so
# the wrong two are never compared:
#       TECDOC/REBUS-3:   8 per half  ==  16 full-height equivalent  [TECDOC]
#       superseded (1):   5 full-height              [MCNP-VISUAL, SUPERSEDED]
#       superseded (2):  20 full-height                  [ASSUMED, SUPERSEDED]
#       this model:      10 full-height        [MCNP — Kyle confirmed 2026-08-12]
# REBUS-3 is moreover a DIFFUSION-based fuel cycle code on FIVE-GROUP ENDF/B-IV
# data with a HALF-CORE model: a different method, a different library and a
# different geometry from this continuous-energy full-core Monte Carlo model.
# It is a data point, not a target, and NOT the basis for N_AXIAL_ZONES = 10.
# Note it also disagrees with the [MCNP] value Kyle confirmed — 16 vs 10 — which
# is unsurprising for a different code and model, and is not a discrepancy to
# reconcile.
#
# COINCIDENCE WARNING — now HISTORICAL, kept because it explains itself.
# This warning was written when N_X_ZONES was 8 and collided numerically with
# TECDOC's eight-per-half. That collision is gone: N_X_ZONES is now 2. The
# warning stays because the hazard it names has not gone away — TECDOC's 8 is an
# AXIAL, half-core, diffusion-model count, and it is a separate number from all
# three of ours. If a future resolution reintroduces an 8 anywhere in this file,
# it will not derive from TECDOC either.
#
# N_X_ZONES and N_AXIAL_ZONES below are the ONLY places the zone counts are
# written. Zone boundaries, volumes and cell counts are all derived from them
# in geometry.py — changing either is a one-line edit and breaks no assertion.
# They are now [MCNP]-backed, so changing them is no longer a free choice:
# it would be a departure from the confirmed reference model.
#
# COST, before you raise either count. READ ALL THREE PARAGRAPHS — the headline
# table cannot see the largest cost of the per-plate change.
#
# CELLS AND MATERIALS NOW SHARE ONE FORMULA: both are
#     614 plates x N_X_ZONES x N_AXIAL_ZONES.
# Raising the resolution therefore costs on BOTH axes simultaneously — more
# cells for transport AND more materials for the depletion solve. Under the old
# element-shared scheme materials were 28 x N_X x N_Z and grew 22x more slowly.
# Anyone proposing a resolution study needs to see this before proposing it.
#
# (1) TRANSPORT. A standard element universe holds 460 meat cells at 2 x 10
# against ~110 in the unzoned model.
#
# HOW OPENMC ACTUALLY FINDS CELLS — corrected 2026-08-12. An earlier version of
# this block said OpenMC "searches cells within a universe linearly, so that ~4x
# is paid on EVERY neutron boundary crossing". THAT WAS WRONG AS STATED, and it
# overstated the transport cost of raising the zone counts. Per OpenMC's Theory
# and Methodology documentation:
#   * Finding a cell from a point (Sec. 2.3) IS a linear loop over a universe's
#     cells, recursing into filled universes. That much was right.
#   * A SURFACE CROSSING (Sec. 2.6) — the common case in transport — searches
#     only that surface's NEIGHBOR LIST. The full linear search is the FALLBACK
#     when the neighbor-list search misses.
#   * Neighbor lists (Sec. 2.7) are CELL-BASED as of OpenMC 0.11 and are built
#     dynamically during transport. OpenMC moved off surface-based lists because
#     those degrade when one surface bounds many cells — exactly what zoning
#     creates, since each shared interior zone plane bounds two cells in all 614
#     plates.
#   * Harper, Romano, Forget, Smith, Nucl. Sci. Eng.,
#     doi 10.1080/00295639.2020.1719765
# So per-universe cell count is NOT paid in full on every boundary crossing.
#
# READ THE SCAN COLUMN ACCORDINGLY. geometry_debug locates points from scratch
# to check for overlaps, which is the unmitigated Sec. 2.3 path — precisely what
# neighbor lists bypass in real transport. The scan is therefore a WORST CASE
# and an UPPER BOUND on the geometry-search term, NOT a transport predictor.
# No transport penalty has been measured and none is estimated here; doing that
# requires an eigenvalue run, which has never been performed on this model.
#
# ALL MEASURED 2026-08-12:
#
#          zones    cells     mats   build   geometry.xml  materials.xml  scan
#  unzoned     -      614        1  0.08 s        0.47 MB      0.002 MB   3.4 s
#  2 x 10     20   12,280   12,280  0.68 s        1.86 MB       4.92 MB   8.4 s
#  8 x 20    160   98,240    4,480  1.55 s       12.16 MB       1.79 MB  47.7 s
#  (The 8 x 20 row used ELEMENT-SHARED materials, 28 x N_X x N_Z — which is why
#   it has FEWER materials than the live 2 x 10 row despite 8x the cells. Only
#   the live row is per-plate. Build times are build_model(); scan is the
#   geometry_debug overlap scan at f=0.5.)
#
# materials.xml grew 22x, 0.22 -> 4.92 MB, tracking the material count exactly.
# geometry.xml barely moved (1.85 -> 1.86 MB): the cells are unchanged, only the
# material ID each one references. That split is the whole story of this change.
#
# DO NOT EXTRAPOLATE THE SCAN COLUMN LINEARLY. There is a large fixed cost
# (~3.2 s of startup at any size), so the cheap end looks flatter than it is:
# 20x the cells from unzoned to 2 x 10 cost only 1.9x the time. Fit a line
# through those two points and it predicts ~28 s at 8 x 20 — the measured value
# is 47.7 s, 1.7x worse. Cost accelerates once cells dominate the fixed overhead.
#
# (2) THE DEPLETION SOLVE — AND THE SCAN COLUMN ABOVE CANNOT SEE IT AT ALL.
# A depletion solve runs a Bateman/CRAM solve PER DEPLETABLE MATERIAL, every

    """One depletion material: one (x, z) zone of ONE plate of `element_id`.

    Fills exactly one meat cell. Materials and meat cells are 1:1 — each plate
    carries its own set of N_X_ZONES x N_AXIAL_ZONES materials and shares
    nothing with its neighbours. [MCNP — Kyle confirmed 2026-08-12]

    plate_index 0 = first plate in the stack (y order), as the geometry builders
                    enumerate them.
    x_index     0 = -x edge of the meat (MEAT_LEFT_X), N_X_ZONES-1 = +x edge.
    zone_index  0 = bottom of the active fuel, N_AXIAL_ZONES-1 = top.

    `volume` is computed by the caller from the authoritative geometry
    dimensions; materials.py holds no geometry constants.

    NOTE the asymmetry in the range guards below: x_index and zone_index are
    bounded here because N_X_ZONES and N_AXIAL_ZONES live in this module, but
    plate_index is only checked for non-negativity. Its upper bound differs by
    element type (N_PLATES_STD 23 vs N_CTRL_FUEL_PLATES 17) and both are
    geometry constants, which this module deliberately does not hold — the same
    reason `volume` is passed in rather than computed. The geometry-side loop
    bounds it naturally: plate_index is the builder's own enumeration variable
    and cannot exceed the plate count it is iterating.

    Composition, temperature (332.1 K) and any S(a,b) are inherited unchanged
    from the base `fuel` material via clone(); nothing is re-specified here, so
    all zoned materials start life identical to the fresh-core fuel.

    Repeat calls with the same key return the same material, so building the
    geometry more than once in a process does not duplicate materials.
