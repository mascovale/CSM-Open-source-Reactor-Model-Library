Simulation settings for the IAEA TECDOC-643 Appendix A-2
Generic 10 MW LEU Research Reactor Core (Argonne design).

About this file:
    This file controls HOW OpenMC runs the simulation — not what
    the reactor looks like (that's geometry.py) or what it's made
    of (that's materials.py). Think of it as the "run instructions".

Key concepts:
    - Criticality (k-eigenvalue) calculation: finds keff
    - Particles: the neutrons OpenMC simulates
    - Batches: groups of neutrons simulated together
    - Inactive batches: early batches discarded while the fission
      source distribution is still settling (not yet converged)
    - Active batches: batches used for actual statistics/results

# RUN PROVENANCE
#
# The OpenMC version is an EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLE in a cross-validation study,
# not an implementation detail. Phase 1 geometry was verified on 0.15.3; the
# production statepoint in model/run_results/ records 0.15.0. Nothing has
# confirmed the two agree, and the difference was only discoverable after the
# fact by reading version attributes out of a statepoint.
#
# This block RECORDS; it does not enforce. A hard version assert would turn a
# cluster upgrade into a build failure on a machine nobody here administers,
# and the failure mode that matters — two versions producing different answers —
# is a comparison defect, not a build defect. The one thing worth failing on is
# the cross-section library (see assert_cross_section_library below).
#
# Computed lazily and cached: at import time this would shell out to git twice
# on every `import settings`, and settings is imported by geometry, tallies and
# every driver.

# This finds keff — the effective neutron multiplication factor.
# keff > 1.0 = supercritical (reaction growing)

# PARTICLE STATISTICS
#
# particles: number of neutrons simulated per batch
# batches:   total number of batches to run
# inactive:  number of batches to discard at the start
#
# Rule of thumb:
#   - inactive batches should be ~40-50% of total batches
#   - more particles = more accurate but slower
#   - start small for testing, scale up for final results
#
# For a first test run (fast, less accurate):
#   particles=1000, batches=50, inactive=20
# For a production run (slow, more accurate):
#   particles=10000, batches=200, inactive=50
# =============================================================================

settings.particles  = 50000    # neutrons per batch (increase for production)

# =============================================================================
# INITIAL FISSION SOURCE
#
# OpenMC needs a starting guess for where fission neutrons come from.
# We use a uniform spatial distribution across the active core volume.
#
# The LATTICE is 6 (x) x 7 (y) = 42 positions: the 5 x 6 = 30 core positions
# plus 12 graphite reflector positions. The FUELLED sub-block — the 28
# standard and control elements, excluding the graphite reflector rows at the
# top and bottom — is 6 columns wide and 5 rows tall, spanning +/-23.1 cm in x
# and +/-20.25 cm in y. The box below covers it with margin in y:
#   x: -3*PITCH_X to +3*PITCH_X  = +/-23.10 cm  (the full 6 fuel columns)
#   y: -3*PITCH_Y to +3*PITCH_Y  = +/-24.30 cm  (covers the 5 fuel rows)
#   z: -HALF_Z to +HALF_Z        = +/-30.00 cm  (active fuel meat height)
#
# Points landing in graphite, flux traps or water gaps are discarded by the
# fissionable constraint below, so over-coverage is harmless.
#
# OpenMC will refine this distribution over the inactive batches
# until it converges to the true fission source shape.
# =============================================================================

# Bounds are IMPORTED from geometry.py, never restated. They were local
# PITCH_X/PITCH_Y = 7.7/8.1 and +/-30.0 literals until 2026-07-31; the audit
# flagged them as the last surviving duplication of geometry constants.
