Geometry definitions for the IAEA TECDOC-643 Appendix A-2
Generic 10 MW LEU Research Reactor Core (Argonne design).

    Appendix A-2: Generic 10 MW Reactor — Argonne National Laboratory.

Core Layout:
    - CORE: 5 x 6 = 30 positions — 23 standard fuel elements, 5 control
      fuel elements, 2 flux traps. [TECDOC A-2 Table 1, "Active Core
      Geometry: 5 x 6 Positions"]. The 12 graphite reflector positions are
      NOT part of the core.
    - LATTICE as built: 6 (x) x 7 (y) = 42 positions — the 30 core positions
      plus the 12 graphite reflector positions, which must live in the same
      RectLattice. This is a modelling extent, not a core description.
    - GRID PLATE: 8 x 9 positions [TECDOC A-2 Table 1, "Grid Plate: 8 x 9
      Positions"] — counts the surrounding water ring. Cite for that row only.
    - Lattice pitch: 77 mm x 81 mm
    - Active fuel meat height: 60 cm; plate height 62 cm

Axial model structure (symmetric about z=0):
    CORE_BOTTOM = -90 cm  (vacuum)
    [-90, -45]  : 45 cm light water
    [-45, -31]  : 14 cm homogenized end-box (0.25 Al / 0.75 H₂O by volume)
    [-31, -30]  :  1 cm unfueled clad extension
    [-30, +30]  : 60 cm active fuel meat
    [+30, +31]  :  1 cm unfueled clad extension
    [+31, +45]  : 14 cm homogenized end-box
    [+45, +90]  : 45 cm light water
    CORE_TOP    = +90 cm  (vacuum) — COINCIDES with the fully-withdrawn (f=1)
                  blade top; no water cap above the withdrawn blade.
    Sum check: 2 * (45 + 14 + 1 + 30) = 180 cm — tripwired below.

Lateral model structure:
    The 6 x 7 lattice is enclosed in an explicit water-filled pool box whose
    lateral faces sit POOL_WATER_THICK = 38.5 cm outboard of the lattice
    envelope. Vacuum boundary at the pool faces.
        x: 6 * 7.7 + 2 * 38.5 = 123.2 cm
        y: 7 * 8.1 + 2 * 38.5 = 133.7 cm
    Pool water is the 294 K bulk water material, NOT the 316.8 K core coolant.

Control blade model — fixed-length sliding absorber:
    BLADE_LENGTH = 60 cm (rigid; never changes)
    ROD_TRAVEL   = 60 cm (full stroke)
    withdrawn_fraction f in [0, 1]:
        z_bot = -30 + f * 60   → f=0: -30,  f=1: +30
        z_top = z_bot + 60     → f=0: +30,  f=1: +90 (= CORE_TOP at f=1)
    b4c fills the absorber-slot x/y band for z in [z_bot, z_top]. A
    BLADE_TOP_CLAD (1 cm) aluminum clad rides directly on the B4C (top end
    only — side and bottom clad are absent by confirmation), and an
    ENDBOX_HEIGHT (14 cm) homogenized (end_box_homog) end-box cap rides on
    the CLAD. Both fill the slot footprint and clip at CORE_TOP. At f=0 the
    stack is B4C [-30,+30], clad [+30,+31], cap [+31,+45] — the cap COPLANAR
    with the surrounding end-boxes falls out of BLADE_TOP_CLAD == CLAD_EXT
    (2026-07-31; supersedes the A4 Option B water band, which the clad now
    fills). At f=1 the B4C top coincides with CORE_TOP (z_top == +90) — it is
    the B4C, not the aluminum, that touches the boundary — and clad and cap
    are clipped entirely out of the model.
    Plate/clad, structural and channel cells run the full plate height
    z=[-31, +31]; only the fuel meat is restricted to z=[-30, +30].
    End-box/water cells cover z outside [-31, +31].

Standard Fuel Element (LEU, U3Si2-Al, heterogeneous build):
    - Envelope:           76 x 80 mm
    - Side plates:        4.8 mm each (aluminum, in x)
    - Active stack:       66.4 mm wide between side plate inner faces
    - 23 plates:          1.27 mm inner, 1.5 mm outer (outer plates clad on
                          both faces of the meat at the outer 0.495 mm
                          thickness, not just the face away from the stack)
    - Fuel meat:          0.51 mm thick x 63 mm wide x 600 mm tall
    - Plate height:       620 mm (600 mm meat + 10 mm unfueled clad each end)
    - Inner clad:         0.38 mm  |  Outer clad: 0.495 mm

All dimensions in cm.

# The zone bounds are derived from the ACTIVE MEAT extents themselves, NOT from

# diverged (62 cm element vs 60 cm meat); zones derived from ELEM_Z would tile
# 62 cm and silently mis-size every depletion volume. The same trap exists in x

# meat. The tiling asserts below test the quantities that matter, in both

#     half-width = (17*PLATE_THICK_INNER + 16*WATER_CHAN_THICK) / 2 = 2.8315 cm
#
#   Each end, from the fuel stack outward to the element wall:

#      B4C blade slot 0.310 | blade water g | Al outer guide 0.150 |
#      outer offset water OUTER_OFFSET]
#   The feeder channel is a standard fuel-to-fuel water channel (matches the
#   follower's own plate pitch). The two blade-flanking water gaps are EQUAL
#   (even spacing) and are the residual after every other layer is fixed:
#     g = (END_BLOCK - 2*CTRL_AL_PLATE_THICK - ABSORBER_THICK - CTRL_OUTER_OFFSET
#          - CTRL_FEEDER_CHANNEL) / 2
#   where END_BLOCK = ELEM_Y/2 - CTRL_FUEL_STACK_HALF (1.1685 cm, fixed by the
#   element envelope and the fuel stack half-width above).
#
# Fixed-length sliding blade:
#   The B4C absorber blade is BLADE_LENGTH=60 cm long and translates in z.
#   At fraction f, the blade occupies z=[z_bot, z_top] = [-30+f*60, +30+f*60].
#   b4c fills the absorber-slot x/y band for z in [z_bot, z_top] across the full
#   model height. Below z_bot, water fills the slot down to the plate bottom
#   (-31) — the blade never dips below z=-30, so the lower end-box/water are
#   uniform material with no reserved slot at all. Above z_top the assembly
#   stack rides with the blade: BLADE_TOP_CLAD (1 cm) aluminum clad, then the
#   14 cm cap riding on the clad, then water to CORE_TOP — each clipped at
#   CORE_TOP; at f=1, z_top == CORE_TOP so clad and cap are both clipped away.
#   All guide/slider/fuel/channel cells are bounded to the PLATE height
#   z=[-31, +31]; only the fuel meat stops at z=[-30, +30]; end-box/water cells
#   fill z outside [-31, +31].

# CORE MAP — position labels for the 6 (x) x 7 (y) LATTICE
#
# This map covers the LATTICE, not the core. The core is 5 x 6 = 30 positions
# (23 standard + 5 control + 2 flux traps); the two all-graphite rows are
# reflector, not core, and bring the lattice to 6 x 7 = 42.
#
# Token grid mirroring lattice_universes below, one token per CORE position:
#   'S' standard fuel   'C' control fuel   'F' flux trap   'G' graphite
# There is no 'W' token: since B4 the water ring is not part of the lattice.
# A token-for-token assert in build_core_geometry() ties this grid to the
# lattice literal, so the two can never drift apart by hand.
#
# TECDOC-643 A-2 Table 1: "Grid Plate 8x9 Positions", "Active Core Geometry
# 5x6 Positions", 23 standard + 5 control elements, and two irradiation
# channels — "1 at Core Center" and "1 at Core Edge" (A-2 §1: one water-filled
# flux trap near the center of the core, another near an edge). The literal
# below places them at D4 (center) and A6 (edge), which is the benchmark
# configuration. Table 1's 8 x 9 is the GRID PLATE row, which counts the
# surrounding water ring; its 5 x 6 is the ACTIVE CORE row. The 42 positions
# modelled here are the 6 x 7 lattice = 30 core + 12 graphite reflector.
#
# Columns A-F run left to right in +x; rows 1-7 run top to bottom, so ROW 1 IS
# THE +y EDGE — matching the array order of CORE_MAP and lattice_universes, so
# a reader comparing the two never has to mentally flip anything.
#
# The letter/number convention is THIS PROJECT'S OWN — TECDOC-643 A-2 specifies
# no element labeling scheme, so the convention itself carries no [TECDOC] tag.
# Labels feed no dimension, surface, or cell region; they name depletion
# materials and nothing else.
